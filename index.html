                About 80% of Minsk was destroyed in World War II, which meant that the city was
                rebuilt in the 1950s with the towering Soviet-bloc buildings that Stalin loved.
                This has made Minsk famous for its Soviet architecture, with big concrete buildings
                and wide avenues, and many hail Minsk as the most perfect example of a Soviet city,
                even claiming that the isolated dictatorship is frozen in time.
              </p>
              <p class="place__paragraph">
                Except Minsk hasn’t frozen in time, and you will surprised by how much of the old Belarusian
                architecture was intact in downtown Minsk, as well as how many new buildings have popped
                up around the city. Minsk is definitely more than its brief Soviet past.

                Muramvya is one of the 18 provinces of Burundi. In the kingdom era, Muramvya was the
                royal capital and in 2007, because of its cultural and natural landscape, it was
                added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. It is located in the center of
                Burundi, between the country's political and economic capitals

                The weather is rather chilly at night, but during the day, you would think you're in
                heaven. At 2,665 meters (8,743 ft) above sea level, Mount Teza is one of the coldest
                places in the province. But that cool breeze allows for one of the largest plantations
                of tea and coffee in the country, which make up the bulk of Burundi's exports.

                The Kibira National Park, one of the largest wildlife reserves for apes, overlaps
                four provinces, including Muramvya. This National Park lies at the apex of the
                beautiful mountains of the Congo-Nile Divide, ranging between 1550 and 2660 meters
                of altitude. It is filled with beautiful vegetation, and a source for the various
                rivers and streams which provide water around the country.

                Berea is a small town located in the central part&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                of Kentucky. The town is
                surrounded by beautiful forests and countryside. It's known as the arts and crafts
                capital of the state, and visitors will find plenty of shopping opportunities:
                shops with handmade jewelry, candles, wood items, galleries,
                glass studios, and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The town holds a yearly festival celebrating "spoonbread", a local dish made
                with cornbread and served with a wooden spoon.

              <p class="place__paragraph">
                However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea College was founded
                in 1855 and was the first college in the south to be racially integrated, as well&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                as the first to be coeducational. Somewhat uniquely,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                it charges no tuition — every student receives&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a full-tuition scholarship.

                The medieval ruin of Cricieth Castle overlooks the town below from a rock that juts
                out into the sea. It is thought to have been built by Llewelyn the Great in the 13th
                century. Some 900 years later, the self-styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of Snowdonia
                has become a popular tourist destination during the summer months.

              <p class="place__paragraph">
                A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the world's best ice cream
                at Cadwalader's, whose secret ingredient is rumored to be locally sourced seaweed.
                Another claim to fame is the fact that Cricieth won the Wales in Bloom award for five
                years in a row for its spectacular floral displays around town. It was also home to David
                Lloyd George, the only Welshman ever to hold the office of Prime Minister of the UK.

                Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on the shores of the
                Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their right mind would swim in the river,
                unless they grew up here, in which case they've probably tried it at some point.
                Summers are hot here, and the winters are drafty, but the fall and the spring are
                are absolutely amazing.
              </p>
              <p class="place__paragraph">
                The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet architecture,
                all of it sprinkled with modified balconies. If you're on the right bank of the
                Dnipro, the landscape is difficult to traverse for people on bikes and those wearing
                heels. The left bank is considered far less interesting and prestigious though,
                even by people who live on the far outskirts of the right one.
