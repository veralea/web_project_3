# Project 3: From Portland to Portland


This is a project about traveling across the US. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

Functionality of this project:
1. Using Figma as a layout specification
2. Development of relative design for different devices
3. Bem-metodology for names of classes
4. Tegs according with HTML5
5. Functionality of CSS3 (calc() function)
6. For a more accurate layout the PixelPerfect extension for Chrome tool was used
